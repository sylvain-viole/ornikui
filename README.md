- Cypress-allure-plugin `2.31.0`

## Setup / installation

- Git clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run cy:chrome:open` to launch Cypress UI with chrome (other commands can be found in the package.json)
- From there you can trig the test suite using Cypress UI

### Reporting
If you want to use Allure reporter make sure you have it [installed locally](https://docs.qameta.io/allure-report/gettingstarted/quickstart)

## Tests

2 scenarios here :

```gherkin
Feature: As an eligible visitor I can receive a quote

    Scenario: [001] eligible visitor requests a quote
        Given a visitor eligible to a quote
        When the visitor gives informations about his vehicle
        And the visitor gives informations about the primary driver
        And the visitor gives informations about the contract
        And the visitor reviews his informations
        And the visitor requests a quote
        Then the visitor receives quotes
     
     
Feature: As an not eligible visitor I cannot receive a quote

    Scenario: [002] not eligible visitor requests a quote
        Given a visitor not eligible to a quote
        When the visitor gives informations about his vehicle
        And the visitor gives informations about the primary driver
        And the visitor gives informations about the contract
        And the visitor reviews his informations
        And the visitor requests a quote
        Then the visitor does not receive a quote
 
 ```


## Architecture / Design Pattern

### ðŸ”— BDD :
This e2e suite uses `GHERKIN` to define scenarios. Each `scenario` step is related to  a js method in a `_steps.js` file.

### ðŸ•º Action Model Pattern
Steps are deployed as a sequence of actions.
This makes the step files readable.
- An `Actor` calls action methods
- `Action methods` call `locators` and interact with them.
This is a `PAGE OBJECT` with an extra layer of abstraction to keep step files readable.

### ðŸ§© Data management
Scenario uses `Personas` which is a data object that centralize all data inputs and expected outputs. Makes it simpler to maintain.

**Data persistence** is handled with a singleton class `DynamicDatas()`

### ðŸ›¼ ApiWaiter
This class allows to wait for API responses in order to kill flakiness
